# An Assured Shorthold Tenancy Agreement in Tex

The motivation for this project is to make [the extremely clunky MS Word document produced by DCLG](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/496722/Model_Agreement_for_an_Assured_Shorthold_Tenancy_and_Accompanying_Guidance.pdf) useable, streamlined and properly editable.

I originally tried to use Legal Markdown, but this runs out of steam after a while, and although I had never used Tex before, this seems to have just the right mix of programmability and print document control.

I am indebted to [Greg Kochansky](https://github.com/gkochans) for getting me started with his Github repository  [Contract Automation Using LaTeX](https://github.com/gkochans/Contract_Automation_Using_LaTeX).

This, like all projects on Github, is a work in progress, especially as I have only had a few days of learning Tex.
